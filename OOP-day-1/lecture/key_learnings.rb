# OOP
# OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

# 1. Everything in OOP is an object
# 2. Every object belong to a class
# 3. Every object has 2 things: STATE(DATA) & BEHAVIOR
# (optional 4.) Encapsulation: expose as little as needed in your classes


# WHAT IS A CLASS?
# 1. Factories of objects
# 2. Cake mold to bake cakes
# "HEllo" # instance of String
# "World" # instance of String
# "Mango" # instance of String
# "Marilou" # instance of String


# Naming Convention
# class names are always in UpperCamelCase
# RaceCar LeWagon Pet
# file names lower_snake_case
# Car class car.rb
# RaceCar class race_car.rb
# ⚠️
