# Ask 2 questions
# 1. Modelling a car: how would we do it
# 2. Built-in methods vs. our own methods
# What's going on here? Welcome to our New Topic: OOP and Classes

# The three Golden Rules of OOP
# 1. Everything in OOP is an object
# 2. Every object in OOP belongs to a class
# 3. Every object has a state (data) and behavior (methods)

# What's a class?
# metaphor 1: factory
# metaphor 2: cake molds

# Back to the string example
# state and behavior of strings?
# state and behavior of humans?

# Vocabulary => instances of a class

# creating our first class: Car!
# naming conventions: file_names, ClassNames
# creating an instance of the car. Creating several instances car1, car2, car3
# Our class is pretty damn boring. Let's try to add state & behavior!

# adding state: the initialize method & how it's connected to the .new
# Show the connection between the .new method and the initialize => puts!
# instance variables. Hard code them first
# What's the problem with hard coding them?
# adding parameters to the .new call => update the initialize method
# explaining what the @ is for.

# adding behavior: instance methods
# basic instance methods :readers!
# basic instance methods :writers!
# shortcuts for both

# another example to make sure everyone understood: Dog class!

# Public & Private Interface
# attr_accessors always? => Encapsulation
# public & private methods
# The 2 main purposes of private methods
